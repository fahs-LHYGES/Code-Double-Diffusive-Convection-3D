# Code-Double-Diffusive-Convection-3D
Fourier Series Code for 3D double diffusive convection
The main code is included in the file "main.f90"
The input files are :
 cav for the mesh
 cav.in for the parameters and defining the Fourier series 
 cav.init fir defining initial geusses for Fourier coeffcient (optional)
cav.st for defining time outputs
